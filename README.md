# 🛡️ Networking Basics for Cyber Security – Wireshark Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security**, completed using **Wireshark**.  
The goal of this task is to gain hands-on experience in **capturing, filtering, and analyzing network traffic** and to understand how common network protocols behave from a **security and SOC analyst perspective**.

This repository contains analysis of **HTTP, TCP, DNS, and TLS/HTTPS traffic**, along with observations relevant to real-world cyber security monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand basic networking concepts (IP, TCP, UDP, DNS)
- Capture live network traffic using Wireshark
- Apply protocol-based filters
- Observe TCP three-way handshake
- Identify plain-text vs encrypted traffic
- Analyze DNS queries and responses
- Build foundational SOC analyst skills

---

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- **Tool Used:** Wireshark  
- **Capture Type:** Live Network Traffic  
- **File Format:** PCAPNG  
- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Protocols Analyzed:** HTTP, TCP, DNS, TLS/HTTPS  

---

## 📚 Networking Concepts Covered
- IP Address & MAC Address
- TCP vs UDP
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- Packet Sniffing
- TCP Three-Way Handshake
- TLS Encryption

---

## 🔍 Task Implementation & Analysis

### 1️⃣ Network Traffic Capture
- Live packets were captured using Wireshark
- Traffic was generated by browsing websites and submitting a login form

---

### 2️⃣ Wireshark Filters Used
```text
http
tcp
dns
tls
tcp.flags.syn == 1
http
tcp
dns
tls
tcp.flags.syn == 1

## 3️⃣ HTTP Traffic Analysis (Plain Text)

-Observed HTTP GET and POST requests

-Login credentials were transmitted in plain text

-Username and password were visible in packet details

#🔴 Security Risk:
-HTTP traffic is vulnerable to packet sniffing and credential theft.

## 4️⃣ TCP Traffic Analysis

- Observed TCP acknowledgements (ACK)

- Reassembled TCP segments confirmed reliable communication

- Identified retransmissions and out-of-order packets

# 🛡️ SOC Relevance:
- Used to detect abnormal sessions, packet loss, or suspicious connections.

## 5️⃣ DNS Query Analysis

- Captured DNS queries and responses

- Observed domain name resolution into IP addresses
- Example:

- testaspnet.vulnweb.com → 44.238.29.244


# 🛡️ SOC Use Case:
- DNS monitoring helps identify malicious domains and command-and-control traffic.

## 6️⃣ TCP Three-Way Handshake

- Identified:

- SYN (connection request)

- SYN-ACK (server response)

- ACK (connection established)

- Multiple SYN retransmissions were observed

# 🧠 Security Insight:
- Abnormal SYN patterns can indicate SYN flood attacks.

## 7️⃣ HTTPS / TLS Encrypted Traffic Analysis
- Observed TLS Client Hello and Server Hello packets

- Application data was encrypted and unreadable

- Secure communication over port 443

# 🔒 Security Benefit:
- HTTPS protects confidentiality, integrity, and prevents credential leakage.

## 📊 Key Observations

- HTTP traffic exposes sensitive data

- TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery

- DNS reveals browsing behavior

- TLS encrypts application data

- Wireshark is a critical SOC investigation tool
